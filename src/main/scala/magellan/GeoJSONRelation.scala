/**
  * A GeoJSON relation is the entry point for working with GeoJSON formats.
  * GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.
  * A GeoJSON object may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features.
  * GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon,
  * MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection.
  * Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties,
  * and a feature collection represents a list of features.
  * A complete GeoJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON terms).
  * In GeoJSON, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs -- also called members.
  * For each member, the name is always a string.
  * Member values are either a string, number, object, array
  * or one of the literals: true, false, and null.
  * An array consists of elements where each element is a value as described above.
