  * A Loop represents a closed curve. It consists of a single
  * chain of vertices where the first vertex is explicitly connected to the last.
  *
  * Loops are not allowed to have any duplicate vertices (whether adjacent or
  * not), and non-adjacent edges are not allowed to intersect. Loops must have at
  * least 3 vertices. Although these restrictions are not enforced in optimized
  * code, you may get unexpected results if they are violated.
  *
  * Point containment is defined such that if the plane is subdivided into
  * faces (loops), every point is contained by exactly one face. This implies
  * that loops do not necessarily contain all (or any) of their vertices.
